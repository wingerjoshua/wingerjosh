# Welcome to General Assembly

Today we'll be using this basic HTML template as the starting point for a simple web page project. To get started,

1. Click the "Download ZIP" button and save the .zip file onto your computer (the desktop is a great place for a project like this).
2. Once saved, unzip the archived folder (double-clicking (Mac), or following [these instructions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/compress-uncompress-files-zip-files) for Windows users).
3. Drag the unzipped folder into your empty editor window and we're ready to go.

Let's get started!
